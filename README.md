A single-player puzzle game where the player's objective is to clear a rectangular board 
containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. The game is played on a grid, and the player must 
use logical deduction to reveal safe squares and avoid the mines.

User Stories:

As a player I want:

-to see a grid of covered cells when I start the game, so that I can begin playing Minesweeper.

-to reveal a cell by clicking on it, so that I can uncover the content underneath.

-to see numbers in revealed cells indicating the number of adjacent mines. 

-the game to end in defeat if I click on a cell containing a mine.

-the game to end in victory if I successfully reveal all non-mine cells.

-to be able to flag a cell that I suspect contains a mine, so that I can mark it and avoid clicking on it accidentally.

-to be able to unflag a cell, so that I can correct any mistakes in flagging.

-to be able to start a new game, so that I can play again without having to refresh the entire page.

-to have different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).

-to see a timer that tracks the duration of my current game, so that I can challenge myself to improve my speed.

-the game to provide feedback or animation when I win or lose.
